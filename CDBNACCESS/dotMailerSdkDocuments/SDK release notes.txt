------------------------------------------------------------

* Handling of contact data fields and their values further improved.

Changes in the dotMailer SDK from version 1.5 to version 1.6

Contact importing now offers two modes of operation, the default is identical in the operation to previous releases, where overwriting data field values with empty data is actively avoided.  A new mode of operation is used when the ImportContactOptions' SortContacts property is set to true, this reduces the number of batches sent to dotMailer but always stores empty data field values.
